## Galaxies
A Sinatra application using backbone.js
Visualization rendered using three.js
- This application was developed using Sinatra, backbone.js, and three.js for the galaxy render.
- I wanted to create more than just a list for this project, so I spent a long time brainstorming on how I could combine my interest in creating visualizations with the requirements of this project. I decided to use backbone.js to update the data and receive input from user, as well as a means to interact with my api. The data is then pulled from the database and creates a new galaxy. As of today, I do not have the visualization finished, as I still have some minimum requirements, but I'm hopeful I will finish it in time.
