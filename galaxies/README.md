## Galaxies

This application was developed using Sinatra, backbone.js, and three.js for the galaxy render.
I wanted to create more than just a list for this project, so I spent a long time brainstorming on how I could combine my interest in creating visualizations with the requirements of this project. I decided to use backbone.js to update the data and receive input from user, as well as a means to interact with my api. The data is then pulled from the database and creates a new galaxy. As of today, I do not have the visualization finished, as I still have some minimum requirements, but I'm hopeful I will finish it in time.

# Major hurdles
At first I had a tough time learning backbone, but after looking at many code examples and experimenting, I feel like I have a solid understanding of it now. API authentication on the other hand is a whole other beast that I think I have spent the longest troubleshooting. I think this is because it is what I have the least experience with. Learning Three.js for this project was maybe too ambitious given the constraints of the project, but it has been incredibly rewarding so far, and I do not regret pushing myself to learn this framework.
