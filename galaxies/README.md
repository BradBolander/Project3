## Matter Factory
This application was developed using Sinatra, backbone.js, and three.js for the galaxy render.
I wanted to create more than just a list for this project, so I spent a long time brainstorming on how I could combine my interest in creating visualizations with the requirements of this project. I used backbone.js to update the data and receive input from user, as well as a means to interact with my api. As of now, this serves primarily as a proof of concept.

# Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Backbone.js
* Three.js
* Sinatra
* Active Record
* SASS
* Postgresql
* ENV

# Installation Instructions
* git clone repository
* install postgresql
* copy / paste migrations
* bundle exec rackup while in directory
* CRUD functionality can be achieved from cocoa rest client


# Major hurdles
At first I had a tough time learning backbone, but after looking at many code examples and experimenting, I feel like I have a solid understanding of it now. API authentication on the other hand is a whole other beast that I think I have spent the longest troubleshooting. Additionally, I had major issues getting the application uploaded to Digital Ocean. I think this is because it is what I have the least experience with. Learning Three.js for this project was maybe too ambitious given the constraints of the project, but it has been incredibly rewarding. I hope to use this application to improve my familiarity with Three.js, and provide a first stepping stone for learning the framework.

# Version 2.0
- API interaction with three.js render
- GUI controls to allow for real time updating and testing
- Options for other shapes other than the squares
- More layers of particles to add other colors
- Updating backend variable names to match their front end counterparts
